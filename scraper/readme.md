Designed a scraper system under this extensive end to end project. Involved scraping from google.com to challenge myself, which has one of the highest security algorithms. <br>

Automated these features in my scraper agents, automated human simulation behavior, prevented scraping detection:
* Rotated different device user agents like Linux, Mac, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 on my Windows 10 PC 
* Removed scraper webdriver flag.
* Automated Incognito mode to prevent cookie and session tracking.
* Use of XPath and varied different selectors
* Applied form submit and login 
* Automated pop-up window interruptions handling 
* scraper responsive to dynamic loading of web page. Pauses, scrolls.
* accessed inaccessible javaScript based page data with script execution while scraping with Selenium
* Simulated human behavior, applied quick scroll, mouse movement. coded scroll, mouse movement all within display height dynamically within window to prevent bounding error.
* Data Transformation and formatted data
* Alternatively can send data to cloud storage platform
* Caught exceptions and recorded any bug report
